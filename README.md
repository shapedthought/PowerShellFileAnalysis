# Welcome to the PowerShellFileAnalysis wiki!

<strong>Needs some serious updating! I will get back to this one day!- 30/07/18</strong>

This is a project that I have started to help me do file analysis for file systems, this is an alternative to using proprietary tools that require sign up and donâ€™t gather some relevant data such as directory depth and directory structure. It is early days at the moment and there are several scripts that do slightly different things. As my knowledge grows in PowerShell my aim is to consolidate this into a single multi-purpose script.

See wiki for more information.
